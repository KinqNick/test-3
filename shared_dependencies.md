1. Scrapy: Scrapy is a Python framework for large scale web scraping. It provides all the tools needed to extract data from websites, process it, and store it in your preferred format. It is used in all the files for web scraping.

2. myanimelist_spider.py: This is the main spider file that contains the scraping logic. It uses Scrapy's Spider class and its methods like start_requests, parse, etc. It is used in the scrapy.cfg file to define the spider and in the pipelines.py file to process the scraped data.

3. items.py: This file defines the data model for the items scraped. It is used in the myanimelist_spider.py file to define the items to be scraped and in the pipelines.py file to process the scraped data.

4. middlewares.py: This file contains the Scrapy middleware classes for handling requests and responses. It is used in the settings.py file to define the middleware settings.

5. pipelines.py: This file contains the Scrapy item pipelines for processing the scraped data. It is used in the settings.py file to define the item pipeline settings and in the myanimelist_spider.py file to process the scraped data.

6. settings.py: This file contains the Scrapy settings for the project. It is used in the scrapy.cfg file to define the project settings and in the myanimelist_spider.py, middlewares.py, and pipelines.py files to configure the spider, middleware, and pipelines.

7. __init__.py: This file is used to indicate that a directory contains a Python package. It is used in all the files to import the necessary modules and classes.

8. DOM Elements: The specific id names of the DOM elements that the JavaScript functions will use to extract data from the website are shared across the myanimelist_spider.py file.

9. Spoiler Show Function: The function to click on the spoiler and show the hidden character traits is shared across the myanimelist_spider.py file.
